WOMP is a modern Windows display profile manager written in Rust, allowing you to save and switch between different display configurations with ease. It's a spiritual successor to [Monitor Profile Switcher](https://sourceforge.net/projects/monitorswitcher/) by Martin Kr√§mer, reimagined with modern technologies.

## Highlights

- üíæ **Save & Load Display Profiles**: Save your current display configuration and switch between profiles easily
- üñ•Ô∏è **Complete Display Management**: Control enabled/disabled state, resolution, refresh rate, and virtual positioning of each display
- üîç **Additional Display Settings**: Save and restore DPI/scaling settings and HDR state.
- üè† **Desktop Customization**: Preserve wallpaper & desktop icon size across profiles
- üîä **Audio Management**: Configure default audio output devices per profile
- ‚ú® **Beautiful Modern UI**: Built with Tauri and React using FluentUI components - perfectly integrating with Windows 11's design language
- üîÑ **System Integration**: Runs in the system tray for easy access
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Actions**: Run arbitrary commands before and after applying profiles
- üé® **Profile Customization**: Add custom icons to your profiles for easy identification

## Use Cases

WOMP is perfect for users who regularly switch between different display configurations:

- **Work/Gaming Setup**: Switch between a multi-monitor productivity setup and a single gaming monitor
- **Presentation Mode**: Quickly configure displays for presentations
- **TV/Media Setup**: Configure displays for optimal media viewing experience
- **Home Office/Entertainment**: Seamlessly transition between work and entertainment display configurations

### Real-world Example

A typical use case involves managing multiple displays:
- 3 desk monitors for regular work
- Single monitor gaming setup (for fewer distractions and better performance)
- TV output for gaming with 144Hz refresh rate
- TV output for movies with 24Hz refresh rate and movie mode

With WOMP, you can create profiles for each scenario and switch between them with a single click!
